# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

Welcome to the JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures project! This repository contains the solutions to a series of tasks aimed at helping you master key concepts in JavaScript. Before you dive into the code, please make sure to read and understand the project requirements and learning objectives outlined below.

## Project Overview

We will be working on a series of tasks related to creating and manipulating JavaScript objects, understanding scopes and closures, and applying object-oriented programming principles. The tasks are designed to enhance your understanding of JavaScript and improve your coding skills.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

**General Knowledge:**
- Understand the significance of JavaScript programming.
- Create objects in JavaScript.
- Explain the concept of 'this' in JavaScript.
- Define 'undefined' in JavaScript.
- Understand the importance of variable type and scope.
- Describe what a closure is.
- Explain the concept of a prototype.
- Inherit an object from another.

**Technical Skills:**
- Implement JavaScript classes.
- Utilize constructor functions.
- Handle edge cases when working with object attributes.
- Create and use instance methods.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles.

## Project Requirements

- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- All code files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all code files should be `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- You must include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Code should be semistandard compliant (Standard + semicolons on top) and follow AirBnB style guidelines.
- All code files must be executable.
- The length of your code files will be tested using 'wc'.
- Usage of 'var' is not allowed.

## Getting Started

To start working on this project, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node.js 14

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Step 2: Install semistandard

```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks, each represented by a separate file. Here's an overview of the tasks and their corresponding files:

1. Task 0: `0-rectangle.js`
2. Task 1: `1-rectangle.js`
3. Task 2: `2-rectangle.js`
4. Task 3: `3-rectangle.js`
5. Task 4: `4-rectangle.js`
6. Task 5: `5-square.js`
7. Task 6: `6-square.js`
8. Task 7: `7-occurrences.js`
9. Task 8: `8-esrever.js`
10. Task 9: `9-logme.js`
11. Task 10: `10-converter.js`

Each task involves creating JavaScript classes, functions, or methods to meet specific requirements. Please refer to the respective task files for detailed instructions and implementation.

## How to Use

To test and run the code for each task, you can use the provided test scripts, as demonstrated in the task descriptions. For example:

```bash
$ ./0-main.js
```
